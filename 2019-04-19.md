# Decision No: 1

## Date: 2019-04-19

## Hypothesis:

People at existing VPN communities will show interest in a VPN service
wherein the end user is able to verify that no logs are kept.

## Deciders: Joseph Holsten, Sean Bethard

## Situation and context:

Deep Woods exists to bring services to the public that are as
transparent as possible.

We provide the source code for as much as possible. This creates a
conflict between limiting access to a paid product vs providing
unlimited access to source. As such, we prefer offering services over
standard protocols to offering proprietary products.

There are several existing open source implementations of standard
protocols that are well suited to the task.

Examples:

-   OpenVPN
-   SMTP/IMAP (cf. Sendmail, Dovecot)
-   DNS (cf. Bind, PowerDNS)
-   PostgreSQL

Hosted software (yes, that's Software-as-a-Service or The Cloud) has a
number of often touted advantages over self-hosted software. Every
competitor in the space is arguing that they create economies of scale,
and these economies of scale create:

-   Lower risk
-   Lower cost
-   Lower time between feature updates

SaaS users can verify differences in cost, and can compare differences
in features in relatively little time accessing the service. But risk is
notoriously hard to judge, and software service providers rarely go out
of their way to communicate the details of risks like outages, data loss
and security breaches.

A fully transparent server implementation means that users do not have
to take our word for it. It enables peer review, so anyone with the
expertise to detect a flaw has the authority to do so.

Which of these open protocols has customers who care most about clearly
defined risks? It's hard to imagine who will care more than VPN users,
who pay specifically to conceal their identity and ensure their privacy.

Among these users, no one protocol dominates like SMTP or IMAP do for
their respective use cases. OpenVPN has the largest user base, but those
users are often happy to switch to similar protocols like IKEv2 and
Wireguard when supported by their clients. IKEv2 is often better suited
when a platform has built-in support for IPSec, but does not run on all
the platforms supported by OpenVPN. Similarly, Wireguard runs
excellently on Linux, but has not released support for Windows.

In conclusion, we see that if we want to make transparent software, we
should

-   run Software-as-a-Service,
-   focus on communicating how we mitigate risk,
-   specialize in the needs of VPN users, and
-   begin with OpenVPN service.

To verify this is true, we want to test that:

People at existing VPN communities will show interest in a VPN service
wherein the end user is able to verify that no logs are kept.

## What's the test process?

If

> People at existing VPN communities will show interest in a VPN service
> wherein the end user is able to verify that no logs are kept.

then

We should create a short offering description that documents our rough
solution to the problem and ask users to let us know if they'd be
interested in paying for it.

We should announce this idea to a number of online communities,
including:

-   reddit subs
-   usenet groups
-   irc channels
-   mailing lists
-   hacker news

Our measurement should be:

-   count of engagements
-   sentiment clustering (manual) into: (good, neutral, bad)

## The (independent) variables that govern the situation include:

We will be sampling users who are already involved in VPN communities.
Those people vary based on:

-   Attitudes: existing VPN customers level of satisfaction with current
    service, willingness to try out something new.
-   Switching costs: most users who will pay are already receiving
    service, so they will need more that an equivalent service to
    consider switching
-   Market growth: as the market grows, users begin to search for
    service but do not have existing service.
-   Experience with alternatives

## What are the range of possible outcomes (dependent variables)?

The engagements of users should be in range:

-   No interest
-   Interest, Positive sentiment
-   Interest, Neutral sentiment
-   Interest, Negative sentiment

## What result would confirm the hypothesis?

Non-insignificant engagements with positive or neutral sentiment.

## What result would confirm the null hypothesis?

Only Negative sentiment and no interest.

## What could lead to errors in measurement?

-   Privacy-aware users are likely not no want to share their actual
    contact information.
-   Bots.
-   Moderators removing our attempts at survey.

## Do we expect the hypothesis to be confirmed?

Yes.

Expected outcomes (totally a guess):

-   No interest: most common
-   Interest, Positive sentiment: common
-   Interest, Negative sentiment: common
-   Interest, Neutral sentiment: uncommon

## If the hypothesis is confirmed, what is the next step?

-   find a minimal way to accept payment
-   sketch out minimal capital outlay to provide initial service
-   go convert engagements into payments

## If the null hypothesis is confirmed, what is the next step?

-   brainstorm ways to change OpenVPN service to acheive higher
    engagement
-   measure engagement for other VPN SaaS options (wireguard)
-   measure engagement for other open protocol SaaS options

## Further Research

-   have some sort of analytics on this page so we can get a sense of
    where people are coming from (with a significant notice informing
    people that we do have analytics enabled, that we still love them
    even if they're blocking analytics.)
-   have an RSS feed so the user is in control of access to
    announcements
-   have a mailing list to publish announcements
-   measure the metrics from [Product Marketing for
    Pirates](https://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2007/06/internet-market.html):

## Review Date (approx 6mo later):

## The outcome:

Verifiable Zero Access at https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivateInternetAccess/comments/ec38a6/announcement_open_source_zero_access/ supports this claim.
