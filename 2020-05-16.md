## The situation/context:

When creating servers, we need to give them names. These need to be unique. Additionally, it's useful to be able to identify their role and location. Server role is case specific, but we should make a single decision about

For example, see https://mullvad.net/en/servers/

## The problem statement or frame:

We need a standard way of referring to resources in different geographical regions, both as part of a resource identifier like a hostname and generally.

## The variables that govern the situation include:

* Region identifier length: ideally this will be short and the same length for every region. 
* Externally determined: we don't want to be in the business of creating abbreviations
* Must be more fine grained than country, at least US & CA will need more than one subregion. Municipality is probably fine-grained enough.
* Avoid terms like `us-west` or `eu-central`. While some users will prefer their vagueness initially, I hypothesize they either care about latency or legal framework. That means they care about municipality or country.

## The complications/complexities as I see them:

* Datacenter operators use different identifiers for their own facilities.
* IANA and FAA codes are notoriously unrelated to the municipalities they serve, making them difficult to remember. For example, IAD for Washington Dulles International Airport often serves for Arlington, VA datacenters. Additionally, they don't always match.
* But using an uncommon "Standard" is nearly as bad as using an extremely popular standard that fits poorly. Either way, people will need to look up values to be certain they are authoring correctly.
* Preference should given to readers over writers. Most people will need to read the region and understand it quickly, some people will need to be able to select from a list, and very occationally new regions will be added to the active set. So readability is most important, followed by difference between values, followed by ease of lookup.

## Explaining the range of outcomes:

* UN/LOCODE identifiers are too long: oh well, it's 6 characters.
* UN/LOCODE identifiers are too imprecise: unlikely, given the size of municipality that receives a code. It is more likely that we will need to have seperate identifiers for each datacenter should we end up having more than one in a single municipality. I can't imagine a solution that would really improve that situation.
* UN/LOCODE identifiers are too opaque: should we need to identify Springfield, TN, US, the code US-SRG is not the most obvious, especially for writing. But hopefully these will not be significant.
* UN/LOCODE identifiers are perfect. 

## What I expect to happen and the actual probabilities are:

Most likely, the most significant difficultly will be identifier opacity. Since this should be lower than that of IANA or FAA codes, I expect UN/LOCODE to be the best option available to us.

I'm not expecting to have any real-world issues with identifier length or precision.
