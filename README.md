# Deep Woods Decision Journal

At Deep Woods Privacy, I'd like to take transparency as far as it can go. Part of that is recording all our decisions.

This is base on Farnam Street's [Creating a Decision Journal](https://fs.blog/2014/02/decision-journal/). If you'd like to start tracking your own decisions, you may [buy a beautiful decision journal of your own](https://www.dejournal.co/).

Note: I am not an affiliate and receive no benefit from your purchase of Farnam Street Decision Journals. Except for the benefit that you'll probably make better decisions in the long run.
