# Deep Woods Decision Journal

At Deep Woods Privacy, I'd like to take transparency as far as it can go. Part of that is recording all our decisions.

As a group, we'll be encountering a number of kinds of decsions:
- hypotheses to test, which use a template similar to a scientific lab journal
- unplanned failures which require corrective and preventative action, which will use a process similar to https://response.pagerduty.com/after/post_mortem_template/
- general purpose decisions,  based on Farnam Street's [Creating a Decision Journal](https://fs.blog/2014/02/decision-journal/). If you'd like to start tracking your own decisions, you may [buy a beautiful decision journal of your own](https://www.dejournal.co/).

Note: I am not an affiliate and receive no benefit from your purchase of Farnam Street Decision Journals. Except for the benefit that you'll probably make better decisions in the long run.
